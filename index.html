        PCPPs are being mass-produced by millions worldwide every day; whilst this is advantageous to people worldwide, many third parties are 
        impacted by this recent development of technology, the biggest being the environment. One example of a PCPP that has caused a rise in 
        “antimicrobial resistance” is Carbamazepine, used in the class of drugs that helps with seizures, mental illness and depression. This 
        specific PCPP can change the microbial structure and function within bacteria, leading to increased antibiotic resistance. (National 
        Library of Medicine, 2019). PCBs are categorised under the same umbrella as PCPPs, but PCB stands for “polychlorinated biphenyls”, which 
        was part of a group of chemicals widely used in the 1980s. This chemical group was mainly man-made and used commercially and industrially.
        (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2024) Above are two examples of PCPPs that currently threaten environments worldwide and are 
        being massively overproduced and overconsumed. Now that the issue has been identified, some research has gone into finding methods to help 
        reverse some of the damage caused by mass production, which will be discussed in more detail in this article.

        PCPP stands for Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products. These are chemicals that most drugs are made of, and they come in a huge variety. 
        They mainly consist of medications that get prescribed to people both over the counter and under the counter. However, they are also found in 
        perfumes/colognes, lotions, and soaps. Certain sunscreens might also use them for their ability to filter ultraviolet rays. Multiple third parties 
        are indirectly impacted by the recent growth in the production of PPCPs due to the recent development of technology for mass production; the 
        environment, non-human species such as aquatic life and farm animals, and human communities are affected by pollution when these products are not 
        disposed of correctly. Although waterbodies within the environment are the most significant third-party affected. (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2013)
        
        PCPPs can find their way into surrounding environments through many pathways; for example, when applying a therapeutic cream, the body has natural 
        absorption processes that absorb chemicals in these creams. Thus, when a person uses their sewage system, it can enter through that. Another more 
        notable source is the factories where the PCPPs are directly produced; if effluent disposal isn’t monitored properly, they can enter water bodies 
        or surface water immediately after disposal, and the chemicals can leach through the soil.(Science Direct, 2022)

      <p class="ex1">
     <pre>
       Another disadvantageous trait that PCPPs come with is that they are bioactive; this means that they will not solubilise or evaporate very quickly at standard 
       temperatures and pressures. Therefore, they quickly enter soil and water using sewage or irrigation systems. If this happens, PCPPs will be known to be harmful 
       to humans and animals. (National Library of Medicine, 2019)
       
       Figure 1: Showing the concentrations of PCBs find in different marine species within their tissue samples (Science Direct, 2022) 
       
       In the graph above, a low concentration of PCBs is found in the tissue of most of the species, although some notable species seem to have an abnormally large 
       concentration, such as the killer whale and white-beaked dolphin. According to the Endangered Species Coalition, orcas that live off the southeast U.S. 
       Pacific coastline are critically endangered. (Endangered Species Coalition, 2022) 
       
       Even before humans were mass-producing antibiotics to treat diseases, there were a vast amount of bacterial species that had already developed an ability to resist 
       antibiotics. We know this due to specimens found in isolated caves, permafrost or other environments and the mechanisms within them to resist antibiotics before mass 
       production of them existed. A significant influence on antibiotic resistance within these microorganisms is the everlasting competition they have for resources between 
       each other in natural environments; this has driven their antibiotic resistance mechanisms to evolve with our technology. (Joakim Larson, Carl Flach, 2021)
       
       If these bacterial species develop resistance to antibiotics, the effects of antibiotics that people take to treat bacterial infections will be cancelled. This is quite 
       a significant public health risk, and many cases considered treatable will no longer be able to be treated. Many antibiotics are PCPPs, so there is a very good reason 
       to try to mitigate the waste released by factories that mass-produce antibiotics into the environment. 
       
       III. Mitigation and Solutions
       
       Ozonation is a process that degrades PCPPs from water systems, helping to remove them. The ozonation process uses ozone, a reactive gas (O3), for indirect and direct oxidation. 
       Ozone is very reactive and has characteristics like low solubility, which allows it to dissolve into water. Once it’s finally dissolved, it will carry out decomposition 
       and oxidation reactions. If ozone reacts directly with the pollutants and can convert them, it is called direct oxidation. The Opposite of this would be indirect oxidation, 
       which is when the ozone breaks down into radicals in the form of a hydroxyl grip; these radicals will then oxidise the pollutants. (Science Direct, 2023)
       
       Nucleophilic attacks occur through addition or elimination mechanisms, this is also how PCPs become ozonated during the process of ozonation and then get decomposed. Before the 
       PCPs are completely degraded the reaction intermediates become more and more biodegradable during ozonation. This would prove useful in PCPs such as “chlorine aromatics” when 
       ozonation is required in coordination with a treatment that is biological. (Nation Library of Medicine, 2022)

    <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
      <p class="ex1">
     <pre>
       After thorough research and analysis, a few things can be identified; PCPPs and their mass production lead to the endangerment of ecosystems and human health. 
       Advanced treatments, tighter restrictions on regulations and increased public awareness may offer paths to mitigation. To properly dispose of medications, 
       do not simply “flush expired or unused medicines down the toilet;” there are programs where medical centres can take back drugs called drug take-back programs. 
       By utilising these, it can help reduce the waste being pushed into the environment. Other things that can be done as consumers such as ourselves are reducing 
       the use of any product, where ingredients which are known have to harsh effects on ecosystems can be found, this includes “endocrine-disrupting compounds”.(Penn State Extension, 2024)
